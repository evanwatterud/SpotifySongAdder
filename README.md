# SpotifySongAdder
Tray app built with Electron to allow adding songs to Spotify library with a global hotkey

###Todos
[ ] Commenting
[ ] Testing on windows
[ ] Allow change of hotkey
[ ] Electron-builder for distribution
[ ] Sound notification if song added

###Why?
Because I got sick of bringing Spotify to the foreground to add a song I'm listening to the my library, and I figured other people would also benefit from this addition.
